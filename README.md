# Real-Life Simulation in C++

Welcome to the Real-Life Simulation project, where we bring the fundamental principles of science to life through cutting-edge C++ simulations! This ambitious project is designed to model real-world systems, starting from the most basic particles and scaling up to complex biological structures like DNA.

**Current Status**: We're just getting started! As of now, the project is about 1% complete. There’s a lot more to come, and we’re excited to continue building and expanding this simulation to cover a wide array of biological and chemical phenomena.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Basic Particles
- **Electrons**: The negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus.
- **Protons**: Positively charged particles within the atomic nucleus.
- **Neutrons**: Neutral particles that stabilize the nucleus.

### 2. Atoms
- **Structure**: Composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons.
- **Examples**: Hydrogen (H), Carbon (C), Oxygen (O) - the building blocks of matter.

### 3. Molecules
- **Simple Molecules**: Water (H₂O), Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) - essential for life.
- **Complex Molecules**: Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆), Amino Acids - key components in biological systems.

### 4. Amino Acids
- **Structure**: Central carbon, amino group, carboxyl group, and a unique side chain.
- **Examples**: Glycine, Alanine - the building blocks of proteins.

### 5. Proteins
- **Composition**: Long chains of amino acids.
- **Structure Levels**: From simple sequences to complex 3D shapes essential for various functions.

### 6. Nucleotides
- **Components**: Nitrogenous base, sugar (deoxyribose or ribose), phosphate group.
- **Examples**: Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine, Uracil - the components of DNA and RNA.

### 7. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
- **Structure**: Double helix made of nucleotides.
- **Components**: Nitrogenous bases (A, T, C, G), Sugar (deoxyribose), Phosphate group - the blueprint of life.

### 8. RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)
- **Types**: mRNA (Messenger RNA), tRNA (Transfer RNA), rRNA (Ribosomal RNA) - crucial for protein synthesis and genetic regulation.

### 9. Genomic Structures
- **Chromosomes**: Large structures containing DNA and proteins (histones).
- **Histones**: Proteins that package and regulate DNA within the chromatin.

### 10. Cellular Structures
- **Organelles**: Specialized structures within cells (e.g., mitochondria, ribosomes).
- **Cells**: The fundamental unit of life, composed of various organelles.

### 11. Tissues and Organs
- **Tissues**: Groups of similar cells performing specific functions (e.g., muscle tissue).
- **Organs**: Complex structures made up of different tissues working together (e.g., heart, liver).

### 12. Organ Systems
- **Examples**: Digestive system, respiratory system - integrated networks performing essential life functions.

### 13. Organisms
- **Types**: Single-celled organisms (e.g., bacteria) to complex multicellular organisms (e.g., plants, animals).

## Design Patterns

- **Abstract Factory**: Create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Construct complex objects step-by-step.
- **Prototype**: Create new objects by copying existing ones.

Stay tuned as we continue to develop this exciting project. We're dedicated to pushing the boundaries of simulation and making science accessible and interactive!
