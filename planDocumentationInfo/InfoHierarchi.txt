Electrons, Neutrons, and Protons:

Basic Particles: Fundamental components of atoms.
Atoms:

Structure: Consist of electrons orbiting a nucleus made of protons and neutrons.
Types: Different types of atoms combine to form molecules.
Molecules:

Composition: Made up of atoms bonded together.
Examples: Water (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂).
Amino Acids:

Structure: Composed of a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable side chain.
Components: Includes molecules like water and carbon dioxide.
Proteins:

Composition: Long chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.
Structure: The sequence of amino acids determines the protein's function and structure.



Nitrogenous Bases: Each base is a molecule made of these atoms.
Examples: Adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil.
Nucleotides:

Structure: Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, a sugar molecule (deoxyribose or ribose), and a phosphate group.
Function: Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).
Nucleic Acids:

DNA and RNA: Polymers made up of long chains of nucleotides.
